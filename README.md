# Types of API
There re 2 types of APIâ€™s.

1)	Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).

2)	REST (Representation State Transfer).

# All WebServices are API. But all API are not Web Service.

API vs WebService
1) Web Service is on API wrapped in HTTP.
2) All Web Services are API but API's are not Web Services.
3) A Web Service needs a network while on API doesn't need a network for its operation.
